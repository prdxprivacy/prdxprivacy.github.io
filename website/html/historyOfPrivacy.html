                        While extremely rare in tribal societies, privacy may, in fact, be instinctive. Evidence from tribal societies suggests that humans prefer to make love in solitude (In 9 of 12 societies where homes have separate bedrooms for parents, people prefer to have sex indoors. In those cultures without homes with separate rooms, sex is more often preferred outdoors).

                        However, Athenians penchant for solitude was not without its influential critics:

                        In 1215, the influential Fourth Council Of Lateran (the “Great Council”) declared 
                        that confessions should be mandatory for the masses. This mighty stroke of Catholic power 
                        instantly extended the concept of internal morality to much of Europe.
                        “The apparatus of moral governance was shifted inward, to a private space that no longer had anything 
                        to do with the community,” explained religious author, Peter Loy. Solitude had a powerful ally.

                        as the default setting of human life.
                        “The ground floor of every building contains a host of tiny rooms that open directly onto the street and each of these tiny 
                        rooms contains a family…they drag tables and chairs out into the street or leave them on the threshold, half outside, half 
                        inside…outside is organically linked to inside…yesterday I saw a mother and a father dining outdoors, while their baby slept 
                        in a crib next to the parents’ bed and an older daughter did her homework at another table by the light of a kerosene lantern…if 
                        a woman falls ill and stays in bed all day, it’s open knowledge and everyone can see her.”

                        The next big advance in information technology, the telephone, was a wild success in the early 20th century. However, individual telephone 
                        lines were prohibitively expensive; instead, neighbors shared one line, known as “party lines.” Commercial ads urged neighbors to use the 
                        shared technology with “courtesy”.

                        By the 60’s, individualized phones, rooms, and homes became the norm. 100 years earlier, when Lincoln tapped all telegraph lines, few 
                        raised any questions. In the new century, invasive surveillance would bring down Lincoln’s distant successor, even though his spying was
